# RGB Root Matriz Color Plotter
by Danielle Gauthier

## Overview
The RGB Root Matriz Color Plotter is an extension of the RGB Root Matriz Color Knotter Map. It is a deterministic model inspired by ecofeminist perspectives on family-making and crafting. This version uses predefined color sequences to analyze and compare different "problems" or concepts, creating a unique approach to poetic linguistic navigation and telepathic communication.

## Features
- User-friendly interface with Bootstrap integration for responsiveness.
- Predefined color sequences representing various concepts or "problems".
- Dynamic result generation based on user selection.
- Comparison of color sequences using similarity scores and dot products.
- Percentile ranking of selected problems among all defined sequences.

## Usage
1. Select a "problem" or concept from the dropdown menu.
2. Click "Expose" to see the analysis results.
3. The result will show the best match (most similar sequence) to your selected problem.
4. The comparison will display the dot product and percentile rank of your selection.

## Technical Details
This project utilizes:
- HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the webpage.
- JavaScript for dynamic content generation and color sequence analysis.
- RGB color model for representing concepts.
- Mathematical functions for calculating similarity scores and dot products.

## Skills and Awareness
This project requires knowledge in:
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Color theory and the RGB color model
- Basic linear algebra (dot products)
- Data analysis and comparison algorithms

## Future Development
- Expand the set of predefined color sequences.
- Implement user-defined custom color sequences.
- Develop a visual representation of the color sequences and their relationships.
- Create an API for integrating this tool into other applications.
- Enhance the analysis with machine learning techniques.
